DEVELOPING ENERGY-BASED CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS IN RADIO COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
Wireless communication networks face significant challenges such as energy efficiency and longevity. 
Energy-based clustering algorithms are one of the methods used to save energy and extend network lifetime in such networks. 
These algorithms divide the nodes in the network into groups based on energy consumption and select certain nodes for collecting, 
processing or transmitting data. There are many energy-based clustering algorithms. Here are some examples:
1. **LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy):** It is one of the most frequently used algorithms in wireless sensor networks.
 This algorithm randomly divides nodes into clusters and selects one node as the cluster leader in each round. Cluster leaders save energy
  by transmitting the data they collect to the main station.
2. **SEP (Stable Election Protocol):** It is an improved version of LEACH. SEP elects cluster leaders by considering the nodes' energy levels and neighbors.
  In this way, a more balanced energy consumption is achieved among the nodes in the network.
3. **TEEN (Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient sensor Network protocol):** This algorithm aims to increase the overall energy
  efficiency of the network by waking up nodes with low energy levels early.
4. **PEGASIS (Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information Systems):** This algorithm connects nodes in a ring and tries to reduce energy consumption
 by transmitting data across the ring.
5. **HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed Clustering):** Groups nodes according to their energy levels and communication costs.
  Nodes with high energy levels are chosen as cluster leaders, while nodes with low energy levels communicate with nodes that consume less energy.
6. **ACO (Ant Colony Optimization):** Divides nodes into groups to save energy based on the behavior of the ant colony.
